## Setting up the Virtual Enviroment for Python

Make a working directory; e.g. /var/working  
change to that directory and run the following commands:  
`virtualenv venv` or whatever "venv" you'd like to use. To keep things simple, we'll use "venv" for now. Once created, to active the python virtual environment run the following:  
`. ./var/working/venv/bin/activate`  

To deactive, run "deactive" from the ./bin directory.
